# Bankruptcy Prediction System

A Java-based solution to better assess financial risk.

## Overview
This project tackles the challenge of detecting early signs of financial instability in banks. Many financial institutions struggle with analyzing complex data and predicting bankruptcy risks. This system provides an advanced tool for assessing financial risk, leveraging data analysis techniques and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

By offering reliable early-stage risk detection, the system empowers banks to anticipate bankruptcy risks and improve financial stability.

## Features
- **Early Bankruptcy Detection**: Identifies potential bankruptcy risks in banks using advanced data analysis.
- **Financial Risk Assessment**: Analyzes financial data to predict future instability.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Uses OOP principles to maintain scalability, reusability, and modularity.

## Technologies
- Java
- Data Analysis Libraries (e.g., Weka, Apache POI, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Run the main class to start the bankruptcy prediction analysis.

## Usage
Once the system is set up, input the financial data of banks into the system. The model will analyze the data and provide predictions regarding potential bankruptcy risks.

## Conclusion
The Bankruptcy Prediction System is an invaluable tool for financial institutions, enabling them to assess and mitigate risk effectively before it becomes critical. By leveraging cutting-edge analysis techniques, it enhances the overall stability of banks and financial systems.
